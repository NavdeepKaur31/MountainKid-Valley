# How to Contribute to the MountainKid-Valley Project

Thank you for showing interest in contributing to the **MountainKid-Valley** project! Whether you're a developer, writer, or just someone who wants to help, we appreciate any contributions. Here's how you can get involved:


## 1. **Submit Changes (via Pull Requests)**

If you'd like to make changes directly (such as fixing a typo, adding a feature, or improving documentation), you can **fork** the repository, make your changes, and submit them via a **Pull Request (PR)**. You donâ€™t need to be a coder to do this! You can make simple changes directly on GitHubâ€™s web interface.

### Steps to create a Pull Request via GitHub's Web Version:
1. Visit the [MountainKid AI GitHub Repository](https://github.com/mountainkidai/MountainKid-Valley).
2. Click the **"Fork"** button at the top right of the page to create your own copy of the repository.
3. After forking, go to your **GitHub account** where the forked repository now exists.
4. Click on the **"File that you want to edit"**.
5. Click the **"pencil" icon** (edit button) on the top right corner of the file view. This will open the file in edit mode directly on GitHubâ€™s web interface.
6. Make your changes (for example, fixing a typo, adding a sentence, or editing content).
7. Once you're done, click commit changes button (top right corner) and write a brief description of your changes in the **"Commit changes"** box.
8. Choose **"Create a new branch for this commit and start a pull request"** to make your changes in a separate branch.
9. Click **"Propose changes"**.
10. On the next page, click the **"Create pull request"** button to submit your changes.

Our team will review the pull request and, if everything looks good, we will merge it into the main repository.
